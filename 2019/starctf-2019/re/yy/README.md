# yy
The binary is actually a scanner generated by [Flex](https://github.com/westes/flex)(It can be found by googling `yylex`). So the core logic is the switch at 0x1281. We don't need to reverse shit-like yylex(). We can find out what it does by debugging. In fact, ignoring the prefix "\*CTF{" and postfix "}", lower letters a-z match the switch cases from 0xf to 0x28 and digits 0-9 match the switch cases from 0x29 to 0x32. Each of such chars will put one certain byte (at 0x2062E0) into the plaintext buffer. And '\_' will trigger the function at 0x3F60. By reversing it we can know that it implements 128bit aes-cbc encryption with hardcoded round keys and if the plaintext buffer is shorter than 16 it will be padded by the bytes at 0x2062B0. Finally the cipher text will be checked and corresponded input is the right flag. So reverse the above process and you will get what you want.
