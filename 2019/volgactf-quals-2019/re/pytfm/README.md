# PyTFM

1. Search string 'transform' in so (you will find the string 'y#:transform' with its function address nearby)
2. Reverse the function and know that it deals with complex number through the call to cexp()
3. Reverse a recursive function carefully and finally know that it actually implements FFT
4. Calculate your flag 

BTW, I solved it in sage cli, so only check\_logic.py shows the logic of the transform function:)
